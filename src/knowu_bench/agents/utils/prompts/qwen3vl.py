For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
<tool_call>
{"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>

# Response format

Response format for every step:
1) Thought: one concise sentence explaining the next move (no multi-step reasoning).
2) Action: a short imperative describing what to do.
3) A single <tool_call>...</tool_call> block containing only the JSON: {"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}.

Rules:
- Output exactly in the order: Thought, Action, <tool_call>.
- Be brief: one sentence for Thought, one for Action.
- Do not output anything else outside those three parts.
- If finishing, use mobile_use with action=terminate in the tool call.
